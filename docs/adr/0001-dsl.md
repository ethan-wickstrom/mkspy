# 0001 â€“ Introduce Orthogonal Task DSL

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project previously described tasks using lightweight dictionaries.
This approach limited reuse and made it difficult to express complex
composable behavior.  The user requested a maximally orthogonal DSL where
each primitive contributes meaning distributively.

## Decision

We replaced the prior task library with a typed DSL.  The DSL defines
independent primitives for data types, operations, and natural-language
specifications.  Composition operators combine primitives locally so the
meaning of a task emerges solely from immediate structure.

## Consequences

- Tasks are represented as `TaskSpec` records composed from primitives.
- The DSL supports predictable extension through new primitives or
  operators.
- Existing components such as `GEPAEvolver` now operate on structured
  `TaskSpec` instances.
